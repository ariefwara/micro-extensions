# Background
The increasing complexity of modern applications, combined with the need to process large amounts of data in real-time, has led to the need for a more scalable and resilient approach to application development. Microservices provide a way to break down applications into smaller, independent components, each with its own database and service responsibilities. This approach allows applications to be more resilient to changes, while still providing the necessary performance and scalability needed.

However, developing and deploying microservices can be complex and time consuming. This project seeks to simplify the process by providing an easy-to-use microservice extension that allows applications to quickly and easily add microservices to their application architecture. The extension will provide specialized database access functions with cross-cache capabilities across replicas, as well as cross-operation between services. This will make the application more flexible and resilient, and allow it to scale in response to changing demands.

The existing frameworks for developing and deploying microservices, such as Spring Boot and JPA, lack the necessary capabilities for scalability and resilience. Spring Boot provides a popular platform for microservice development, but lacks the cross-cache and cross-operation features needed for efficient scaling. Similarly, JPA facilitates data access, but it is limited to managing application data and does not consider the application as a whole in a cluster. 

The new microservice extension seeks to bridge this gap by providing the required cross-cache and cross-operation capabilities. These features allow applications to be more flexible and robust, and facilitate scaling in response to changing demands. This enables developers to easily and effectively integrate microservices into their application architecture, leading to improved reliability and scalability.

Furthermore, the extension is designed to be user-friendly and offers a simple and intuitive interface. This makes it easier for developers to incorporate microservices into their applications and allows them to focus on their application logic instead of spending valuable time configuring the microservices. As such, developers can quickly and easily add microservices to their applications and scale them in response to changing demands.
