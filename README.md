# Background
The increasing complexity of modern applications, combined with the need to process large amounts of data in real-time, has led to the need for a more scalable and resilient approach to application development. Microservices provide a way to break down applications into smaller, independent components, each with its own database and service responsibilities. This approach allows applications to be more resilient to changes, while still providing the necessary performance and scalability needed.

However, developing and deploying microservices can be complex and time consuming. This project seeks to simplify the process by providing an easy-to-use microservice extension that allows applications to quickly and easily add microservices to their application architecture. The extension will provide specialized database access functions with cross-cache capabilities across replicas, as well as cross-operation between services. This will make the application more flexible and resilient, and allow it to scale in response to changing demands.

The current popular frameworks for developing and deploying microservices, such as Spring Boot and JPA, do not focus on the capabilities needed for scalability and resilience. Spring Boot is a popular framework for developing microservices, but it does not provide the necessary cross-cache and cross-operation capabilities. JPA is a popular framework for data access, but it does not provide the necessary cross-cache and cross-operation capabilities.

The new microservice extension seeks to fill this gap by providing the necessary cross-cache and cross-operation capabilities. By providing these capabilities, the extension makes applications more flexible and resilient, and allows them to scale in response to changing demands. This will allow developers to more easily add microservices to their application architecture, and make their applications more reliable and scalable.

Additionally, the extension is designed to be easy to use, and provides a simple and intuitive interface for developers. This makes it easier for developers to quickly add microservices to their applications, and allows them to focus on developing their application logic instead of spending time configuring the microservices. As a result, developers can easily add microservices to their applications, and quickly and easily scale their applications in response to changing demands.
