# Background
## Microservice Architecture
Microservices architectures offer a flexible and scalable approach to software development, enabling faster development, easier maintenance, increased scalability, and better code reusability. To ensure that microservices are well designed and efficient, developers must take a holistic approach to the entire system, including how microservices communicate with each other, how data is shared between replicas within services, and how services interact with other architectural components. Frameworks like Spring Boot and JPA/Hibernate can help make development easier, but they cannot provide a complete solution for efficiently sharing data between replicas and, worse yet, they can increase the risk of data bloat and system complexity. Therefore, developers should strive to create their own customized solutions, tailored to their specific data sharing needs, to maximize the effectiveness of their microservices.

## Pipeline Pattern
The pipeline pattern is an effective software architectural design pattern used to link multiple processing steps, thereby allowing data to be passed between each step in the chain. Spring Boot offers a special mode known as WebFlux, which is geared towards providing non-blocking capabilities; however, this mode can add complexity to the system and can be difficult to implement. An alternative solution is to use the standard Spring Boot framework in conjunction with a pipeline for a more efficient and powerful workflow. Additionally, the implementation of asynchronous tasks must be improved in order to accommodate high loads and low latencies. The Spring Boot standard already allows for the implementation of asynchronous tasks with @Async, however, there is currently no way to arrange or coordinate tasks in a predetermined order. Therefore, it is essential to make early adjustments in order to ensure optimal performance.

# Objective
This extension for Spring Boot allows developers to build efficient and robust solutions for sharing data between replications in microservices. It provides custom parallel assertions, database access components, http client components, and caching components, enabling developers to chain multiple processing steps in parallel or sequentially, while also leveraging a central in-memory database for improved performance and scalability. This extension also allows developers to configure and manage their own data consistency policies, providing better control over data accuracy and integrity. Additionally, a powerful data caching system is included, allowing for minimized memory usage and data consistency between replicates.

This extension facilitates reducing application instantiation or replicas memory  to a minimum, by externalizing data and only internalizing it when it needs to be processed. In this way, applications can focus solely on their processing capabilities, while allowing infrastructure scalability to process as many requests as possible. By achieving this level of optimization, system efficiency is expected to increase.
